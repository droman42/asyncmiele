# Miele Device Configuration Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for adding device setup, provisioning, and configuration management functionality to the asyncmiele library.

## Overview

The goal is to extend the asyncmiele library to support the complete lifecycle of Miele device management, from initial discovery and setup to ongoing configuration management, while maintaining the library's design principles.

> **Important Note:** Before executing each phase of this plan, a comprehensive review of the `~/development/MieleRESTServer` codebase should be conducted to ensure full understanding of the relevant implementation details, protocols, and techniques. This reference implementation contains valuable insights for each aspect of Miele device communication and setup that should inform our implementation decisions.
